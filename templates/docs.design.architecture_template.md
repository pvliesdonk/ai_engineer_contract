# Architecture

## Intent

- Use this template to document system architecture under `docs/design/`.
- Keep it tool-agnostic; include YAML front matter with `doc_type: architecture` and `doc_version: YYYY-MM-DD.rN`.
- Commit diagram sources (Mermaid/PlantUML/Graphviz) alongside the doc.

## Context

- Problem statement
- Constraints
- Quality attributes (reliability, security, performance, etc.)

## High-level Design

- Components
- Interfaces / APIs
- Data model & storage
- External dependencies

## Risks & Trade-offs

- Options considered
- Rationale

## Open Questions

-

## Diagrams

- Link to diagram sources (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML), not just images.
