# CONTRIBUTING

- Branch from `origin/develop` using `feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>`.
- Use **Conventional Commits** for PR titles; include Summary/Why/Changes/Validation/Risk/Notes.
- Keep docs updated in `docs/design/` and `docs/kb/`.
- Releases are created via the configured release tool; merges to `main` are manual.
