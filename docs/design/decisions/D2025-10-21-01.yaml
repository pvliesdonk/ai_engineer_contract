prompt: How do we simplify SCM-C into an advise-only workflow?
options:
  - label: Retain existing chat-only guidance
    summary: Keep SCM-C focused on template scripts/zip bundles without redefining deliverables.
  - label: Hybrid (allow advise-only or zip bundles)
    summary: Permit both inline guidance and artifact uploads, leaving escalation rules informal.
  - label: Advise-only with documented templates
    summary: Limit SCM-C to structured guidance, codify escalation triggers, and publish reusable templates.
choice: Advise-only with documented templates
rationale: Aligning SCM-C around structured guidance eliminates zip/patch friction, clarifies escalation points, and keeps outputs auditable for humans.
