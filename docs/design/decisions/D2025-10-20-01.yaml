prompt: How do we harden agent governance and documentation quality gates?
options:
  - label: Clarify contract guardrails only
    summary: Update ENGINEERING_CONTRACT.md with guidance but leave CI/docs workflows optional.
  - label: Add CI + templates only
    summary: Require phase gate and docs-quality automation without clarifying operating guidance.
  - label: Full governance hardening
    summary: Ship updated guidance, workflows, and model recommendation expectations together.
choice: Full governance hardening
rationale: Bundling guidance, automation, and planning expectations ensures feedback #90/#87 resolve together and keeps repos auditable.
