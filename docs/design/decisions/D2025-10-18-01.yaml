prompt: What work may agents perform before receiving “GO BUILD”?
options:
  - label: Allowed pre-build work
    summary: Docs-only edits, repository admin (labels/projects), planning artifacts.
  - label: Disallowed pre-build work
    summary: Code scaffolding, test harness creation, non-doc file additions.
choice: Allowed list + disallowed list + PR checklist
rationale: Clarifies the contract-first workflow and keeps implementers from jumping to code prematurely.
