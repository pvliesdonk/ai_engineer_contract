SCM Mode Decision Tree
======================

Intent
------

- Provide a quick checklist for agents to determine which Session Capability Mode (SCM) they are operating in.
- Clarify which operations are allowed per mode and when to pause for human confirmation.

Decision Flow
-------------

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Session] --> B{Can you read/write the filesystem?}
    B -- No --> SCMC[SCM-C\nAdvise-Only]
    B -- Yes --> C{Can you run git push or gh?}
    C -- No --> SCMB[SCM-B\nIDE Co-Driver]
    C -- Yes --> D{Do you have push rights / tokens?}
    D -- Yes --> SCMA[SCM-A\nFull-Stack]
    D -- No --> SCMB
```

Mode Summary
------------

| Mode  | Allowed Operations                                                                 | Requires Confirmation                  |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SCM-A | Create branches/PRs, push commits, run CI, create repos/projects, manage labels     | Repo creation, visibility changes, secrets updates |
| SCM-B | Local edits, diff generation, scripts/patches, documentation updates                | Any action that mutates remote state (ask human) |
| SCM-C | Advise-only packages (issue/plan/PR bodies, reviews, checklists, single-file diffs) | Any filesystem or git action; multi-file or automated changes |

Confirmation Checklist
----------------------

Before performing privileged operations (repo creation, branch protection, secret rotation):

1. State the intended action and confirm the mode.
2. Ask for explicit human approval if outside SCM-B boundaries.
3. Log the approval (issue/PR comment or chat transcript).
