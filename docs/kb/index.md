## Intent

- This section is an example knowledge base structure that implements the contract’s guidance.
- Some links may be placeholders; stub pages are provided to illustrate organization.

# Knowledge Base

Welcome! Start here. Organize topics with stable slugs and headings.

## Sections

- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)
- [Architecture Deep Dives](./architecture/README.md)
- [How-Tos](./howtos/README.md)
- [Dual Role – Canonical vs Instance Assets](./dual-role.md)

> Keep links relative; avoid link rot. Commit diagram sources (Mermaid/PlantUML/Graphviz). Use YAML front matter.
