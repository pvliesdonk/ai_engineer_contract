- **SECURITY.md** — coordinated disclosure: <https://github.com/pvliesdonk/ai_engineer_contract/blob/develop/.github/SECURITY.md>
- **CODEOWNERS** — default reviewers: <https://github.com/pvliesdonk/ai_engineer_contract/blob/develop/.github/CODEOWNERS>
- **Manifest** — machine-readable contract paths and labels: <https://github.com/pvliesdonk/ai_engineer_contract/blob/develop/ai/manifest.json>

For downstream consumers, copy or adapt these to your repository.
