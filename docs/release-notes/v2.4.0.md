# Release v2.4.0 â€“ Policy-driven Phase Gate

## What changed
- Add `policy` block to `ai/manifest.json` describing base branch, release automation, docs roots, and phase-gate rules.
- Refactor `.github/workflows/phase-gate.yml` to consume manifest policy, emit structured failure reports, and comment on blocked PRs.
- Introduce `tools/contract_lint.py` with a CI workflow to verify manifest shape, required artifacts, and label taxonomy.
- Document policy knobs in the contract, capsule, and README so humans know where to look.

## Why it matters
- Downstream repos can override governance via manifest policy instead of editing workflows.
- Contributors now receive actionable guidance when the phase gate stops a PR, reducing back-and-forth.
- Contract linting catches drift early and keeps generated docs and metadata aligned.

## Actions for consumers
- Ensure your fork includes the new `ai/manifest.json::policy` block when syncing this release.
- If you customize phase rules, mirror the structure before relaxing build requirements.
- Run `python tools/contract_lint.py` (or enable the provided workflow) to validate your copy after syncing.
